# Writing Changelogs
Changelogs are used to log the changes per each build version of Taiga. 

If you have forked and hosted your own version of Taiga, you are advised to use changelogs to show your progress with the 
bot.

## Latest Changelog
You can view the latest changelogs of your bot using the `changelog` command.

## Creating A Changelog
Changelog files can be generated by using the following commands:

```bash
$ cd scripts
$ generate_changelog.py <changelog_name>
```

Generated changelog files can be found in the `changelogs` folder in the root directory.

#### buildNumber
Build version of your latest changes.

#### buildTitle
Name of the latest build version or title of the set of changes.

#### changes
Array of strings for each change. 

Taiga automatically joins each and every change in this array to form the changelog content displayed.

#### releaseDate
Date of which the changes were released.

#### contributors
Array of strings for each contributor for that set of changes.

Taiga automatically joins each and every contributor into a list to be displayed.
